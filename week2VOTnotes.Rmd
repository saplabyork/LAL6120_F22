## VOT basics

* The primary acoustic characteristic corresponding to phonological voicing in oral stops is voice-onset time or *VOT*
* VOT is the time elapsed between the release of the oral closure and the onset of the periodic oscillation of the vocal folds
* Languages exploit this timing (a)synchronization to signal [voice] distinction

From Lisker and Abramson (1964):
"for voiced stops the formantless segment corresponding to the closure interval is traversed by a small number of low-frequency harmonic components, while in the case of voiceless stops the closure interval is essentially blank"

* The above image shows an utterance of [$p^h$a]. In the waveform representation, the area between the two dashed lines on the left is the VOT. There is some *art* required in the measurement of VOT and not all researchers will have the same landmarks for the beginning of the consonant release and the onset of vocal fold oscillation. As long as the research defines her criteria and remains consistent in measurement, then it's not an issue.

* In the image above, the vocal fold oscillation is taken at the "zero-crossing" of the first period of the voicing. What constitutes a period?

* The onset of the VOT is taken as the onset of transient noise which is consistent with the stop burst release. 

Lisker and Abramson say that "articulatory force" is another phonetic factor separating the voicing categories, though what does it mean? They say it is "proprioceptive"&rarr; the speaker has a sense that it is more efforful or stronger
