```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Task

You were asked to record yourself saying "heat," "heat," "hoot," "hot," and "hut," and then measure F1 and F2 for each word from the steady-state portion of the vowel. The resulting data are here:

```{r}
vowels <- read.csv("LING2200_vowels.csv", header=TRUE)
vowels
```

## Class vowel space

Here is the code to generate the vowel space for the class:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
vowel_plot <- ggplot(vowels, aes(x = F2, y = F1, color = vowel, label = vowel)) + labs(title = "LING2200 vowel space") +
     geom_text() + xlim(0,4000) + ylim(0,1500) + scale_y_reverse() + scale_x_reverse() +  stat_ellipse() + theme_bw()
vowel_plot
```
