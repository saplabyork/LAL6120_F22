<h1>Software installation</h1>
<p>This course introduces you to some basics of instrumental phonetic
analysis. You will need the following two pieces of software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Praat: Acoustic phonetic analysis software. It’s free and available
<a href="http://www.praat.org">here</a>. Please download it and follow
the installation instructions.</li>
<li>R Studio: R is a statistical analysis language and R Studio is the
user interface which allows you to do a variety of things with data,
like modeling and visualizing. We’ll just scratch the outermost surface
of what R allows you to do. But first you’ll need to have the R software
(R Studio sits on top of the basic R software!). Go <a
href="https://cran.rstudio.com/">here</a> to first download R onto your
machine. Then download R Studio for free <a
href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">here</a>.
Here’s a nice <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFGYlKvQEQ4">video</a> that walks
you through the process.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="acoustics-basics" class="section level1">
<h1>Acoustics basics</h1>
<p>Any course in phonetics will assume some basic understanding of how
speech is produced and what the nature of the speech signal is like
(i.e., what it’s made of and how it relates to the vocal apparatus).
These notes are meant to give you a brief introduction of the basics of
acoustics as it relates to speech sounds. This by no means comprehensive
and you should be encouraged to seek out explanations for more difficult
questions you might have about the details of speech acoustics. The
internet is your friend, but there are plenty of books which can help
you along the way. Ask me and I can offer some suggestions.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="the-speech-chain" class="section level1">
<h1>The Speech Chain</h1>
<p>The speech chain represents the nature of communicating a linguistic
message via the vocal-audition apparatus.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/speech-chain.jpg">
</p>
<p>In this course, we will be examining, in detail, the nature of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acoustics</strong>: the physical properties of sound</li>
<li><strong>Production</strong>: the physical process of producing
sounds</li>
<li><strong>Perception</strong>: the psychological process of speech
reception</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="sound" class="section level1">
<h1>Sound</h1>
<p>Sound is essentially changes in air pressure that results from some
sort of disturbance, like the smacking of a table top or the vibrating
of vocal folds. For speech sounds, tiny changes in pressure are a result
of air molecules beign set in motion by the movement of the vocal folds.
These changes in air pressure between air molecules end up at the
listener’s ear. This animated gif schematizes the general idea of some
movement (the hand moving up) setting in to motion the rope. The change
in air pressure is represented by the wave in the rope, which moves and
ultimately reaches a target (or the listener’s ear).</p>
<p><img
src="https://ds055uzetaobb.cloudfront.net/uploads/RemWkGv8Lh-rope1.gif" /></p>
<p>Molecules of air move in a random pattern, called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian motion</a>
and collide with each other and other objects at a relatively constant
pressure.</p>
<p align="center">
<img width="200" height="200" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/15/38/66/153866beb99a7ec456ae1e6b0d643aea.gif">
</p>
</div>
<div id="airflow" class="section level1">
<h1>Airflow</h1>
<p>Air moves from an area high pressure to an area of low pressure in
order to equalize → driving pressure. Air only moves when there is a
pressure differential between the areas. If there is no difference in
pressure between the two areas, there is no airflow. This is very
important for speech, as will become clearer when we discuss place and
manner of articulation.</p>
</div>
<div id="pressure" class="section level1">
<h1>Pressure</h1>
<div id="boyles-law" class="section level2">
<h2>Boyle’s Law</h2>
<p>Another important concept for our understanding of speech processes
is that formulated by the English polymath, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle">Robert Boyle</a>.
Boyle’s law characterized the relationship between the pressure of a gas
and the volume of its container.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boyle’s Law says that that pressure and volume are inversely related.
The bigger the container, the lower the pressure; the smaller the
container, the higher the pressure of the gas within.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.makeagif.com/media/9-27-2015/TnlTsV.gif">
</p>
<p>For our purposes, it’s useful to imagine the relationship between two
containers, or the same container at different points in time. In the
equation below, imagine a fixed mass of gas (ok, air). The relationship
between the pressure of that gas and the volume of the container is
constant. So increasing the volume would mean a decrease in pressure (so
long as the mass of the gas is the same and the temperature doesn’t
change).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P_1 V_1~ = P_2 V_2 \]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">
<img width="300" height="300" src="images/boylelaw.gif">
</p>
<p>We know that there are air molecule pressure changes, cumulatively,
involved when the volume of the container shrinks or expands, but what
exactly happens between individual air molecules?</p>
</div>
<div id="compressionrarefaction" class="section level2">
<h2>Compression/Rarefaction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When air molecules collide there is a moment of high pressure. This
is called <strong>compression</strong>. The idea here is simple and can
be roughly analogized to the Boyle’s law examples above. Imagine the
plunger and bottom wall of the piston are air molecules. As they
approach each other (or are compressed), pressure between them
increases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>M<sub>1</sub>→→→→M<sub>1</sub> M<sub>2</sub><br />
As M<sub>1</sub> approaches M<sub>2</sub> there is increasing pressure
(compression)</p>
<p align="center">
<img height="150" width="500" src="images/compression.gif">
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the molecule “bounces” back and overshoots its original
position, it causes an area of low air density, resulting in low
pressure → rarefaction</p>
</blockquote>
<p>M<sub>1</sub> ← M<sub>1</sub> ←←← M<sub>2</sub><br />
As M<sub>1</sub> moves away from M<sub>2</sub> there is decreasing
pressure (rarefaction)</p>
<p>Here is a nice <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYoTRx6gGX0">video
demonstration</a> and explanation of compression and rarefaction of air
molecules.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="simple-harmonic-motion" class="section level1">
<h1>Simple harmonic motion</h1>
<p>Simple harmonic motion (SHM) results when the restoring force on an
object is proportional to the displacement from equilibrium in the
opposite direction. SHM is a special type of periodic motion (we’ll
discuss periodicity below) that refers to the a back and forth motion
that repeats itself at regular intervals.</p>
<p>With SHM, there is acceleration of an object through the “zero point”
or equilibrium and deceleration at the endpoints of the movement. In the
animation below, the weight’s equilibrium point (or the spring’s natural
length) would be represented by y=0.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/pendulumshm.gif">
</p>
<div id="frequency" class="section level2">
<h2>Frequency</h2>
<p>One back and forth movement through the equilibriam point constitutes
one <em>cycle</em> of vibration.When describing sound, these cycles
refer to the movement of air molecules moving back and forth. When the
molecule is set into motion (from some disturbance, like the movement of
the vocal folds or the slamming of a door), it is propelled, reaches
some maximum, travels back through its original starting point
(equilibrium) and proceeds again in the direction opposite the one it
initially travelled, then back again to equilibrium (one complete
cycle).</p>
<p>This movement results in pressure changes. A cycle when describing
sound is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One cycle = increase in P from P<sub>atm</sub> (compression), a
decrease in P below to P<sub>atm</sub> (rarefaction), then increase back
to equilibrium The number of cycles completed in one second is called
the <strong>frequency</strong> and is measured in Hertz (Hz)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For speech, we very often encounter frequencies in the thousands, so
instead of writing, say, 5600 Hz, we might change the units to kilohertz
(1000 Hz) giving us 5.6kHz.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/pANIvSh2r2A">Here</a> is a strobe video of
a tuning fork. The tines (or arms) of the fork vibrate in unison, moving
away from equilibrium, reaching a maximum displacement, then back toward
the center and beyond, then back again.</p>
</div>
<div id="period" class="section level2">
<h2>Period</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>period</strong> of a waveform is the time it takes for
one cycle to occur</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Period is inversly proportional to frequency. So: <span
class="math display">\[F = 1/t ; t = 1/F\]</span> If the frequency is
100Hz (or 100 cycles per second), then the period is 1/100 or 0.01
seconds. Period is symbolized as <em>t</em>.</p>
Here’s a little practice question: If <em>t</em> = 0.003, then what is
the frequency? <!-- Answer options go here -->

<div id="wavelength" class="section level2">
<h2>Wavelength</h2>
<p>The distance completed by one complete cycle of the sound wave is
called its <strong>wavelength (λ)</strong>. Wavelength is given in
<em>m</em> or <em>cm</em>. The higher the F, the shorter the period
(remember F=1/t) and wavelength. Conversely, the lower the F, the longer
the period and wavelength.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/wavelength.png">
</p>
</div>
<div id="velocity" class="section level2">
<h2>Velocity</h2>
<p>Just how fast a sound wave moves (or its <strong>velocity</strong>)
depends upon the nature of the medium, the substance in which the wave
is moving (e.g., air, water, concrete). Denser media allow sounds to
travel faster, so sound travels faster in water (than air), and even
faster in steel or concrete.</p>
<p>Temperature also affects the velocity of sound, though not so much in
liquids and solids. As temperature increases so too does the velocity of
the sound wave. So, in warmer air, the velocity of sound increases at a
rate of 0.6m/s /deg C.</p>
<p>The “speed of sound” (v) is roughly 330 m/s. (Be <strong>very
careful</strong> with the units of v as some questions will require you
to convert!) There is a <strong>very important</strong> relationship
between frequency and wavelength, which relies on v: <span
class="math display">\[F = v/λ\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="amplitude" class="section level2">
<h2>Amplitude</h2>
<p>In our description of period, frequency, and wavelength we have (till
now) ignored a very important component of our sound wave, namely the
displacement of the wave from equilibrium. Remember we referred to
“maximum displacement” above?</p>
<p>This maximum <em>height</em> of the wave, above and below the
equilibrium point, is called <strong>amplitude</strong>. For practical
purposes (which we’ll spend some time discussing later in the course),
the amplitude corresponds to the loudness of a sound. Amplitude is
measured in bels or decibels (bel/10).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="pure-and-complex-sounds" class="section level1">
<h1>Pure and complex sounds</h1>
<p>A sound can be composed of one or more frequencies <span
class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> remember that these
frequencies represent the movement of the sound wave (itself made up of
the movement of air molecules)</p>
<div id="pure-tones" class="section level2">
<h2>Pure tones</h2>
<p>If a sound consists of a single frequency it is called a <strong>pure
tone</strong>. A pure tone can be described by <strong>simple harmonic
motion</strong>, which is depicted as a sine wave, with a frequency,
period, wavelength, etc. Here is an example of a <a
href="sounds/440Hz.wav">pure tone</a>, one where one complete cycle of
the wave repeats itself 440 times per second (or with a frequency of 440
Hz). Below is an image of the waveform depicting the 440 (I did this in
Praat…can you?):</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/440sine.png" width="70%" height="70%">
</p>
<p>Musicians among you may know this tone as the note “A” in a Western
traditional 12-tone scale system. If you have a piano or keyboard
nearby, play this tone, then the “A” key. Are they the same note? How
does your piano (or any other in-tune instrument) sound different from
the tone?</p>
<p align="center">

<p><br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="complex-sounds" class="section level2">
<h2>Complex sounds</h2>
<p>A note struck on the piano <em>does</em> sound different from the
pure tone above. The reason it sounds different is because the vibrating
metal string in the piano, when struck, produces the 440Hz tone <em>as
well</em> as other tones (called “overtones”) resulting in a
<strong>complex sound</strong>. The complexity of the sound contributes
to the overall <em>voice</em> of the instrument (or “timbre”). Complex
sounds can be either <strong>periodic</strong> or
<strong>aperiodic</strong>.</p>
<div id="periodic-sounds" class="section level3">
<h3>Periodic sounds</h3>
<p>A complex periodic sound would be like notes playes from an
instrument or even vowel sounds coming out of your mouth!</p>

<h3>Aperiodic sounds</h3>
<p>Aperiodic sounds are not periodic (or quasi-periodic); the waveform
does not show any repeating quality (or periodicity). There are two
types of aperiodic sounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aperiodic sounds are sounds that do not repeat</li>
<li>Aperiodic sounds are of two types: a <strong>transient</strong>
sound or a sound that occurs just once, for a very short time (e.g., a
hand clap, a balloon pop, or even one cycle of a sine wave!); a
<strong>noise</strong> sound where the pressure at each moment is random
and does not depend on the previous moment (e.g., a tire leaking air or

<h2>Complex periodic sounds</h2>
<p>Periodic complex sounds are made up of frequencies of sound that are
<em>systematically</em> related to each other:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The lowest frequency is called the <strong>Fundamental
Frequency</strong>. The fundamental frequency is abbreviated
<strong><em>F<sub>0</sub></em></strong>. The fundamental frequency is
based on the periodicity of the entire complex sound. The fundamental
frequency is not just the frequency of the <strong>lowest component of
the complex sound</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Frequencies above <strong><em>F<sub>0</sub></em></strong> are
called <strong>harmonics</strong>. For a complex periodic sounds,
harmonics are the whole number integer (or a number that can be written
down without a fraction part, e.g., 35, 5, 28374) multiples of the
fundamental frequency.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For most <strong>naturally</strong> generated complex periodic sounds
(like guitar strings, tuning forks, etc.), the source generating the
sound vibrates at the fundamental frequency AND at each integer multiple
of the F<sub>0</sub>. So, for example, if the F<sub>0</sub> of a tuning
fork is 350Hz (ie., the tines of the fork vibrate back and forth 350
times every sec), it also vibrates at 2 x 350Hz, 3 x 350Hz, 4 x 350Hz, 5
x 350Hz, etc. <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span>

decreases. So the loudest harmonic is the first one, the

at 2 x 100Hz or 200Hz, with a component at 300, 400, 500Hz, etc. Notice

<div id="the-myoelasticaerodynamic-theory-of-phonation"
class="section level1">
<h1>The myoelastic/aerodynamic theory of phonation</h1>
<p>In our last lecture we noted the complexities involved in the
movement of vocal folds given the highly variable nature of their
composition as well as their elongation and position governed by
muscular control of the arytenoids and associated muscles. The most
widely accepted theory explaining the nature of vocal fold vibration or
oscillation is called the <strong>myoelastic</strong> theory, which
explains oscillation as the interaction between muscle forces
(<em>myo-</em>), tissue elasticity, and air pressure flow.</p>
<p>The myoelastic/aerodynamic theory of phonation was first described by
the Dutch speech scientist <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janwillem_van_den_Berg">van den
Berg</a> in 1958. It basically states that vocal folds open up due to
sub-glottal pressure and close due to elastic and aerodynamic pressures.
But that’s too simplistic. Here are the specific steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Musicular activity causes the arytenoids so that the vocal
processes come together thereby positioning the vocal folds close
together (adduction)</p></li>
<li><p>Sub-glottal pressure (air pressure below the vocal folds)
increases until the vocal folds are forced apart.</p></li>
<li><p>With narrow opening of the vocal folds (being pushed apart by the
sub-glottal air pressure) escaping air travels fast (this is called the
<em>Venturi tube effect</em>). The fast moving air through the narrow
passage causes a momentary decrease in air pressure across the opening
(this is called the <strong>Bernoulli effect</strong>)</p></li>
</ol>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/bernoulli.jpg" width="40%" height="40%">
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The decrease in pressure across the folds causes the folds to be
sucked together (this is part of the Bernoulli effect you might be
familiar with, it’s the reason why when you’re in the shower the curtain
might be sucked in toward you or <em>lift</em> of airplane
wings)</p></li>
<li><p>The Bernoulli effect AND the myoelastic recoil forces of the
vocal folds themselves cause adduction</p></li>
<li><p>When fully adducted the process begins all over again with an
increases in sub-glottal pressure. The process repeats resulting in
phonation!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the image below, notice that inferior (“lower lip” in the picture)
and superior (“upper lip”) aspects of the vocal folds adduct at
different times. Initially the inferior aspect abducts and ultimately
the superior aspect. Similarly, during abduction, the inferior aspect
closes before the superior aspect.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/myo.jpeg" width="40%" height="40%">
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div id="phonation-threshold" class="section level2">
<h2>Phonation Threshold</h2>
<p>Just how much sub-glottal pressure is required to pop open the
adducted vocal folds? The minimum pressure required is called the
<strong>phonation threshold pressure</strong> (PTP). The PTP varies
proportionally with F<sub>0</sub>. With increasing F<sub>0</sub> so is
PTP. For example, for low F<sub>0</sub>s PTP can be around 3cm
H<sub>2</sub>0 and up to around 6cm H<sub>2</sub>0 at higher
F<sub>0</sub>s.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="spectrum-1" class="section level1">
<h1>Spectrum</h1>
<p>Phonation is the oscillation of the vocal folds back and forth, in a
roughly periodic fashion. Like all of our discussion of complex periodic
waves (like the complex wave resulting from plucking a string or blowing
into a flute), there is a fundamental oscillation, and an infinite
number of harmonics at frequencies systematically related to the
fundamental. The resulting <strong>spectrum</strong>, in idealized form,
would look like the line spectra seen in earlier lectures.</p>
<p>The spectrum of harmonics produced by the oscillating vocal folds is
called the <strong>glottal spectrum</strong>, which is unique for how
the amplitude characteristics diminish with increasing frequency. This
diminishing of amplitude is called the <strong>spectral
slope</strong>.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/sourcespec.png" width="30%" height="30%">
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The glottal spectrum has to be inferred from the sound coming out of
a mouth, that is, we never get to hear exactly the sound of the vocal
folds oscillating. When we synthesize the source spectrum, it often
sounds like <a href="sounds/sourcespec.wav">blowing rasberries</a>, that
is, it lacks the “shape” of a vowel sound, which is the filtered glottal
spectrum through the oral and nasal cavities. The harmonic content of
the glottal spectrum theoretically decreases by <strong>12dB per
octave</strong>. What’s an <em>octave</em>? The name reveals that it has
to do with ‘8’, or the eight musical notes that occupy the interval
between a particular frequency and twice that frequency. So an octave
higher than 220Hz will be 440Hz, and likewise, an octave below would be
110Hz. So, for the glottal spectrum, the harmonic that is twice the
fundamental will have an amplitude 12dB less than the fundamental.</p>
<p>If the first harmonic (F0) is 200Hz with an amplitude of 36dB, the
harmonic at 400Hz (H2) will have an amplitude of 24dB. The harmonic with
800Hz (H4) will have an amplitude of 12dB, the harmonic at 1600Hz (H8)
will have an amplitude of 0dB.</p>
<div id="harmonic-spacing" class="section level2">
<h2>Harmonic spacing</h2>
<p>When the vocal folds elongate, via tilting the thyroid cartilage, so
too does the <strong>harmonic spacing</strong> of the spectrum. Remember
that the harmonics of a complex periodic wave are whole number multiples
of the fundamental. So a 100Hz fundamental will have tighter spaced
harmonics (100Hz), than a 200Hz fundamental. The spacing of the
harmonics contribute to the timbre of the sound. This explains why kids
sound different from adults, and not just higher pitched.</p>
</div>
<div id="vocal-tract-resonance" class="section level2">
<h2>Vocal tract resonance</h2>
<p>The human vocal tract is really well suited for producing a wide
variety of sounds. The length of the vocal tract as well as the coupling
of various tube-like structures (like the oral cavity, the pharynx, the
nasal cavity) all contribute to <a href="lecture5.html">filter</a>
shapes that amplify many different frequency bands when in different
configurations.</p>
<p>At some point in the course of evolution, the larynx began to sit
lower in the neck relative to our nearest human-like primate ancestors
(<a
href="https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-neanderthalensis">Homo
Neanderthalensis</a>). Neanderthals had a larynx higher in the neck,
resulting in a shorter vocal tract.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/neanderthal.jpg" width="60%%" height="60%">
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The vocal tract is a <strong>resonator</strong>, just like we saw in
the tube and Helmholtz discussion. The resonator is a filter that “let’s
through” some frequencies from the glottal spectrum, and attenuates (or
“turns down”) other frequencies. There are four important
characteristics of the resonator:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The tube is closed at one end (open-closed) <span
class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> quarter-wave resonator with
lowest resonance with a wavelength of 4x the length of the tube. Higher
resonances are odd multiples of the lowest resonance. Remember: <span
class="math display">\[
F_1 = \frac{v}{4L};
F_2 = 3(\frac{v}{4L});
F_3 = 5(\frac{v}{4L});
F_4 = 7(\frac{v}{4L})...
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The vocal tract can be considered a series of containers (a
sequence of attached tubes). Each tube has its own resonant frequency
(RF), with each cavity acting as a bandpass filter (amplifying certain
frequencies and attenuating others)</p></li>
<li><p>The vocal tract is a <em>broadly tuned</em> resonator, letting
though a wide bandwidth of frequencies</p></li>
<li><p>The vocal tract is a <em>variable resonator</em> that is, the
tubes are not of uniform dimension. The cross-sectional areas and length
of the tubes are constantly changing. Take a look at the video below and
see how quickly the shape of the oral and pharygeal (the area above the
larynx) changes. Consequently the frequency response of the connected
tubes are constantly changing.</p></li>

</div>
</div>
<div id="formants" class="section level1">
<h1>Formants</h1>
<p><strong>Formants</strong> are what we call the lowest resonant
frequencies of the vocal tract resonator. So if we think about the vocal
tract like a filter, it will have resonances at various frequencies
(given in the equations if we model the vocal tract like an open-closed
tube). These resonances are also called <em>prominences</em> or areas in
the frequency spectrum where the glottal sound is amplified.</p>
<p>When we talk specifically about formants, we’re dealing with speech.
That is, we don’t talk about the harmonic resonances of tubes as
<em>formants</em>, which is reserved for vocal tract resonances. The
lowest frequency is the <strong>first formant</strong> abbreviated as
<strong>F1</strong>. Higher formants are odd multiples of F1 for a
basic, uniform length open-closed tube. This is comparable to a basic
vowel sound called <strong>schwa</strong> which is written as
<strong>ə</strong>.</p>
<div id="schwa-and-vocal-tract-length" class="section level2">
<h2>Schwa and vocal tract length</h2>
<p>The average male ə has an F1=500Hz, F2=1500Hz, F3=2500Hz, and
F4=3500Hz. Can we calculate the length of the average male vocal tract
based on these formants? Well, we know that: <span
class="math display">\[F_1 = \frac{v}{4L}\]</span> If we take <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> = 340m/s, we need to convert it to cm,
because vocal tracts are much smaller than a meter, so <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> = 34000cm/s. So we have: <span
class="math display">\[
500Hz = \frac{34000cm/s}{4L}
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
4L = \frac{34000}{500}; L = \frac{68}{4} = 17cm
\]</span></p>

</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="source-filter-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Source-filter model</h2>
<p>The formal model of vowel production is called the
<strong>source-filter model</strong> and was developed by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnar_Fant">Gunnar Fant</a>. At its
core, the source-filter model is quite simple. Now that you know that
the vocal folds produce a spectrum of frequencies when oscillating (or
the <strong>source</strong>), the vocal tract acts as a
<strong>filter</strong> for that source, so what we hear when someone
speaks is the output of this process.</p>
<p>There are three components to the source-filter model:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The glottal source spectrum</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>transfer function</strong> of the vocal tract: the
acoustic prominences in the frequency spectrum, often visualized as a
spectral <em>envelope</em> or shape of the filter</p></li>
<li><p>The output spectrum which we actaully hear</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the schematic picture below, the source spectrum has a
F<sub>0</sub> of 100Hz and likely has the typical 12dB/octave roll-off.
That spectrum is fed into the vocal tract transfer function (notice the
shape of the envelope). The output function has a shape similar to the
transfer function, with certain frequencies amplified and others
dampened, so the vocal tract makes an imprint on the output sound.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/source_filter.jpg" width="60%%" height="60%">
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Again, the model above is an idealized model of a relatively
open-closed tube giving rise to schwa. Of course languages use many many
more vowels sounds than the idealized schwa. The envelope of the
transfer function for all other vowels reflect the relationship between
the oral (the mouth) and pharyngeal (space above the larynx) cavities.
The changing shape of the two connected cavities is affected by the
tongue and the lips. You can make the oral cavity larger by articulating
a vowel further back in the mouth (like /u/ “ooo”) and moving it more
forward to make the cavity smaller (like in /i/ “eee”).</p>
<p>The volumes of the two cavities affect their resonances, with smaller
volumes generally having resonances at higher frequencies and larger
volumes at lower frequencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first formant (F1) is related to the size of the pharyngeal
cavity (and the tightness of the constriction). F2 is related to the
length of the oral cavity</p>
</blockquote>
<p>F1 and F2 are used to acoustically classify vowel sounds. Let’s take
a look at oral and pharyngeal tract shapes and how they affect F1 and F2
in common vowels.</p>
</div>
<div id="i-and-a" class="section level2">
<h2>/i/ and /a/</h2>
<p>The /i/ vowel is in words like “keep” or “eel”. It’s produced with
the tonge blade (a technical term we’ll come back to) forward in the
mouth towards the palate, which results in a large cavity behind the
construction, essentially makig pharyngeal cavity large. As a result, F1
is lowered. The cavity in front of the tongue is small and short,
resulting a high F2.</p>
<p>The /a/ vowel is the one in word like “father” (though there’s lots
of variation, this is roughly in the right neighborhood). The tongue
configuration here is smoewhat the opposite of the configuration for
/i/, with a small pharyngeal cavity (high F1) and a large oral cavity
(low F2).</p>
<p>We can also extend (and shorten) the length of the oral cavity by
manipulating the lips. By rounding your lips, you’re essentially
extending the length of the oral cavity because they end up being
protrouded. Likewise when you spread your lips, you shorten the oral
cavity relative to a neutral position. In the picture below, you’ll see
models of /i/ and /u/ (where the lips are rounded). Notice that the
tongue is in roughly the same position, with similar pharyngeal volumes.
The oral cavity for /u/ is longer and as a result F2 is lower than in
/i/.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div id="vowel-formants" class="section level2">
<h2>Vowel formants</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, vowels are generally characterized by F1, F2, and
sometimes F3. How can we change F1 and F2? We can change length of the
vocal tract and we can also change how tightly we articulate or the
degree of the constriction. When the tongue is moved to a particular
position we have control over how close to palate the tongue is. If it
is making contact with the palate then the air is stopped behind the
constriction (which is what we do with consonants or stops). For vowels,
the tongue must approach the palate but not make contact. The closer the
constriction in the vocal tract (or the tighter the articulation), the
lower the F1. If there is a constriction with the back of the tongue, F2
is lowered. If the front of the tongue is constricted, F2 will raise,
and F1 will lower (as the constriction is in the vocal tract).</p>
